Hi, I'm Liz ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer - mostly working on backend code, trying to make the world a better place through the medium of software

## About me

I've been writing software for over 25 years now so I've had the privilege of working across many industries from manufacturing to B2B sales via data providers and national legislature; with all of the fun, ever evolving datastores and modelling techniques I got to play with along the way. Equally happy cutting edge newness and getting legacy code into good shape so it can carry on for as long as it's still needed.

## Technical skills

* **Languages & Frameworks**: Ruby, Rails, Python
* **Databases & Search**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL, Elasticsearch, OpenSearch
* **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS, Google Cloud, Docker
* **Payments & APIs**: Stripe
* **Tools & Practices**: Git, GitHub, CI/CD, Agile, Async & Remote Collaboration, Pair Programming
